# Description
I created and fill this repository with only one goal â€” to **help** beginner developers better understand the essence of basic things in IT, because I remember how difficult it was for me to understand these truly **fundamental** things on my own. I tried to organize the code as neatly and clearly as possible so that it would be easier for beginners to navigate. I also specifically separated the description and implementation of functions so that you could get used to the proper formatting of code in your future projects :)

## Installation
You need to move to the working directory and clone this repository with HTTPS:

```git clone https://github.com/falafe1y/ForBeginners.git```  

or SSH:  

```git clone git@github.com:falafe1y/ForBeginners.git```

## Compilation

For compilation, you need to specify the `main.cpp` file, the file with the implementation of the algorithm or structure you are interested in, for example, `BubbleSort.cpp`, the compilation flag, and the name of the binary file, for example, `main`:

```g++ main.cpp BubbleSort.cpp -o main```

## Content
In this repository you will find fundamental algorithms and data structures in C++, namely:
- **Algorithms**:  
  - [x] Bubble sort
  - [x] Insert sort
  - [x] Selection sort
  - [ ] Counting sort
  - [ ] Radix sort
  - [ ] Shaker sort
  - [ ] Fast sort
  - [ ] Heap sort
  - [ ] Merge sort

- **Data structs**:
  - [ ] Stack
  - [ ] Heap
  - [ ] Graph
  - [ ] Tree
  - [ ] Vector
  - [ ] Hash-table
  - [ ] Linked list
